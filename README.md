Projects from Intro to Graphics taught by Professor Stan Sclaroff at Boston University, Fall 2014

Bug Simulator - Used OpenGL to create a bug with moveable/rotatable parts.

Vivarium - Used OpenGL to create a "vivarium" with two creatures - a predator creature and prey creature. 
The predator creature attempts to catch and "eat" the prey while the prey creature avoids the predator.
Users are able to add food that the prey can move towards and "eat".
